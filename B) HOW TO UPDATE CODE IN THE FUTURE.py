"""
MONTHLY UPDATES:
The code was written in June, 2021. So, the dates must be updated for each class that is listed in "A) HOW TO RUN THE CODE".
I have placed a comment above each such place. A Ctrl/Cmd + F with "date" or "Filtering Interviews Conducted By Month"
should help find these. 2021-06 needs to be replaced by current YYYY-MM

UPDATES FOR ADDITION OF BUSINESS UNIT:
Select all(Ctrl/Cmd + a), copy(Ctrl/Cmd + c) and then paste (Ctrl/Cmd + v) any existing Business Unit into a new Python
File.
Replace the abbreviation of selected Business Unit(eg. M_G) with desired abbreviation by Selecting all(Ctrl/Cmd + a),
then replacing(Ctrl/Cmd + r) accordingly.
Similarly, repeat this for the entire Business unit(eg. Delivery) with the full name of the Business Unit that is added
to "Interviewer R&R.xlsx"
